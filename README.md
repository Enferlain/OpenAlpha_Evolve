# OpenAlpha_Evolve: Regenerating Autonomous Algorithmic Discovery üöÄ

![openalpha_evolve_workflow](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d4709ad-0072-44ae-bbb5-7eea1c5fa08c)

OpenAlpha_Evolve is an open-source Python framework inspired by the groundbreaking research on autonomous coding agents like DeepMind's AlphaEvolve. It's a **regeneration** of the core idea: an intelligent system that iteratively writes, tests, and improves code using Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google's Gemini, guided by the principles of evolution.

Our mission is to provide an accessible, understandable, and extensible platform for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to explore the fascinating intersection of AI, code generation, and automated problem-solving.

## ‚ú® The Vision: AI-Driven Algorithmic Innovation

Imagine an agent that can:

*   Understand a complex problem description.
*   Generate initial algorithmic solutions.
*   Rigorously test its own code.
*   Learn from failures and successes.
*   Evolve increasingly sophisticated and efficient algorithms over time.

OpenAlpha_Evolve is a step towards this vision. It's not just about generating code; it's about creating a system that *discovers* and *refines* solutions autonomously.

## üß† How It Works: The Evolutionary Cycle

OpenAlpha_Evolve employs a modular, agent-based architecture to orchestrate an evolutionary process:

1.  **Task Definition**: You, the user, define the algorithmic "quest" ‚Äì the problem to be solved, including examples of inputs and expected outputs.
2.  **Prompt Engineering (`PromptStudio`)**: This agent crafts intelligent prompts for the LLM. It designs:
    *   *Initial Prompts*: To generate the first set of candidate solutions.
    *   *Mutation Prompts*: To introduce variations and improvements to existing solutions, often requesting changes in a "diff" format.
    *   *Bug-Fix Prompts*: To guide the LLM in correcting errors from previous attempts, also typically expecting a "diff".
3.  **Code Generation (`CodeProducer`)**: Powered by an LLM (currently configured for Gemini), this agent takes the prompts and generates Python code. If a "diff" is requested and received, it attempts to apply the changes to the parent code.
4.  **Evaluation (`SolutionEvaluator`)**: The generated code is put to the test!
    *   *Syntax Check*: Is the code valid Python?
    *   *Execution*: The code is run in a temporary, isolated environment against the input/output examples defined in the task.
    *   *Fitness Scoring*: Programs are scored based on correctness (how many test cases pass), efficiency (runtime), and other potential metrics.
5.  **Database (`DatabaseAgent`)**: All programs (code, fitness scores, generation, lineage) are stored, creating a record of the evolutionary history (currently in-memory).
6.  **Selection (`EvoSelector`)**: The "survival of the fittest" principle in action. This agent selects:
    *   *Parents*: Promising programs from the current generation to produce offspring.
    *   *Survivors*: The best programs from both the current population and new offspring to advance to the next generation.
7.  **Iteration**: This cycle repeats for a defined number of generations, with each new generation aiming to produce better solutions than the last.
8.  **Orchestration (`EvolveFlow`)**: The maestro of the operation, coordinating all other agents and managing the overall evolutionary loop.

## üèÅ Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Python 3.10+
    *   `pip` for package management
    *   `git` for cloning

2.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shyamsaktawat/OpenAlpha_Evolve.git
    cd OpenAlpha_Evolve
    ```

3.  **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Set Up Environment Variables (Crucial for API Key)**:
    *   Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env` in the project root:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    *   **Edit the `.env` file** and add your `GEMINI_API_KEY`:
        ```env
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
        *You can obtain your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).*
    *   The system will prioritize the key from the `.env` file. If it's not found, it will use a non-functional placeholder from `config/settings.py` and print a warning. **Ensure your `.env` file is correctly set up.**

6.  **Review Configuration (Optional)**:
    *   Open `config/settings.py`. Here you can:
        *   Change the default LLM models used for generation (`GEMINI_PRO_MODEL_NAME`) and evaluation (`GEMINI_EVALUATION_MODEL`).
        *   Adjust evolutionary parameters like `POPULATION_SIZE` and `GENERATIONS`.
        *   Modify API retry settings or logging levels.

7.  **Run OpenAlpha_Evolve!**
    The `main.py` file is configured with an example task (Dijkstra's algorithm). To run it:
    ```bash
    python -m main
    ```
    Watch the logs in your terminal to see the evolutionary process unfold! Log files are also saved to `alpha_evolve.log` (by default).

## üí° Defining Your Own Algorithmic Quests!

Want to challenge OpenAlpha_Evolve with a new problem? It's easy:

1.  **Open `main.py`**.
2.  **Modify the `TaskDefinition` object**:
    *   `id`: A unique string identifier for your task (e.g., "sort_list_task").
    *   `description`: A clear, detailed natural language description of the problem. This is crucial for the LLM to understand what to do. Be specific about function names, expected behavior, and constraints.
    *   `evolve_function`: The name of the Python function the agent should try to create/evolve (e.g., "custom_sort").
    *   `io_examples`: A list of dictionaries, each containing an `input` (arguments for your function) and the corresponding expected `output`. These are vital for evaluation.
        *   Inputs should be provided as a list if the function takes multiple positional arguments, or as a single value if it takes one.
        *   Use `float('inf')` or `float('-inf')` directly in your Python code defining these examples if needed by your problem (the evaluation harness handles JSON serialization/deserialization of these).
    *   `allowed_imports`: Specify a list of Python standard libraries that the generated code is allowed to import (e.g., `["heapq", "math", "sys"]`). This helps guide the LLM and can be important for the execution sandbox.
    *   (Optional) `evaluation_criteria`: Define how success is measured (currently primarily driven by correctness based on test cases).
    *   (Optional) `initial_prompt_override`: Override the default initial prompt if you need more specific instructions for the first code generation attempt.

3.  **Run the agent** as before: `python -m main`.

The quality of your `description` and the comprehensiveness of your `io_examples` significantly impact the agent's success!

## üîÆ The Horizon: Future Evolution

OpenAlpha_Evolve is a living project. Here are some directions we're excited to explore (and invite contributions for!):

*   **Advanced Evaluation Sandboxing**: Implementing more robust, secure sandboxing (e.g., using Docker or `nsjail`) for code execution to handle potentially unsafe code and complex dependencies.
*   **Sophisticated Fitness Metrics**: Beyond correctness and basic runtime, incorporating checks for code complexity (e.g., cyclomatic complexity), style (linting), resource usage (memory), and custom domain-specific metrics.
*   **Reinforcement Learning for Prompt Strategy**: Implementing the `RLFineTunerAgent` to dynamically optimize prompt engineering strategies based on performance feedback.
*   **Enhanced Monitoring & Visualization**: Developing tools (via `MetricsLogger`) to visualize the evolutionary process, track fitness landscapes, and understand agent behavior (e.g., using a simple web dashboard or plots).
*   **Broader LLM Support**: Adding easy integrations for other powerful LLMs (e.g., OpenAI models, Anthropic Claude).
*   **Self-Correction & Reflection**: Enabling the agent to analyze its own failures more deeply (e.g., analyze error messages, identify patterns in failed tests) and refine its problem-solving approach.
*   **Diverse Task Domains**: Applying OpenAlpha_Evolve to a wider range of problems in science, engineering, data analysis, and creative coding.
*   **Community-Driven Task Library**: Building a collection of interesting and challenging tasks contributed by the community.
*   **Improved Diff Application**: Making the diff application more robust or exploring alternative ways for the LLM to suggest modifications.
*   **Crossover Implementation**: Adding a genetic crossover mechanism as an alternative or supplement to LLM-driven mutation.
